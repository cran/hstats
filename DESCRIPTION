Description: Fast, model-agnostic implementation of different H-statistics
    introduced by Jerome H. Friedman and Bogdan E. Popescu (2008)
    <doi:10.1214/07-AOAS148>.  These statistics quantify interaction
    strength per feature, feature pair, and feature triple.  The package
    supports multi-output predictions and can account for case weights.
    In addition, several variants of the original statistics are provided.
    The shape of the interactions can be explored through partial
    dependence plots or individual conditional expectation plots. 'DALEX'
    explainers, meta learners ('mlr3', 'tidymodels', 'caret') and most
    other models work out-of-the-box.
